            <h1>Shelter for a Family</h1>
            <p>Not a single family, who became homeless for sudden floods and river erosion over the last week, turned
                up at the government opened shelters knowing that it might be quite a while for them to return home.

                Many of them lost their houses and every last pieces of tangible property to erosion while others
                suffered losses partly. All of them had to leave houses anyway as the Padma and the Gorai flowed above
                the danger mark at three places until Friday.</p>

            <h1>Education for a Child</h1>
            <p>The worst flooding to hit this area in years has devastated homes, damaged crops and cut off access to
                villages across five districts. Flooded latrines have contaminated wells and other water supplies,
                depriving children and their families of access to clean water. Over 1.5 million children are at
                increased risk of waterborne diseases, drowning and malnutrition.

                Tragically, three children below the age of 15 died after being struck by lightning in thunderstorms
                that set off torrential rain.
